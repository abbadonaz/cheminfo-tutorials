# cheminfo-tutorials

This repository contains a curated collection of **small, focused cheminformatics projects** developed in Python.  
The goal is to build **strong foundations for data-driven drug discovery**, with an emphasis on **clean workflows, reproducibility, and interpretability**.

The projects here serve as:
- practical exercises in cheminformatics
- building blocks for more advanced ML / Pharma AI projects
- reference implementations for common tasks in computational chemistry

***Scope & Learning Objectives***

- Molecular data acquisition from public databases
- SMILES preprocessing and standardization
- Descriptor calculation and exploratory analysis
- Reproducible cheminformatics workflows
- Preparation of chemical data for downstream ML models

***Projects in Python***

| Project Name | Short Description |
| ------------ | ----------------- |
| [Compound Data Acquisition](https://github.com/abbadonaz/Cheminformatics/tree/main/CompoundDataAcquisition) | Data download using ChEMBL API, very basic cleaning and preprocessing |
| [SMILES Preprocessing and Basic Descriptors](https://github.com/abbadonaz/Cheminformatics/tree/main/SMILESPreprocessing) | SMILES preprocessing and standardization, basic descriptor calculation, data visualization |

## 📚 Selected Learning Resources

The following resources strongly influenced the structure and best practices used in this repository:
 - [RDKit blog](https://greglandrum.github.io/rdkit-blog/)
 - [Practical Cheminformatics](https://practicalcheminformatics.blogspot.com/)
 - [TeachOpenCADD](https://projects.volkamerlab.org/teachopencadd/index.html)
 - [Is life worth living? blog of personal interest](https://iwatobipen.wordpress.com/)

NOTE! 
- The emphasis is on **clarity over complexity**
- Notebooks are used for exploration; reusable logic is gradually moved into scripts
- Projects may evolve as new techniques are added
