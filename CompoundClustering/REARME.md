## Compound Clustering in Chemical Space

This tutorial notebook demonstrates an unsupervised cheminformatics workflow for exploring
chemical space using molecular fingerprints and clustering techniques.

### Key steps
- Bioassay data preprocessing
- Molecular standardization with RDKit
- Fingerprint generation
- Unsupervised clustering
- Visualization and interpretation

### Relevance
Chemical clustering is widely used in cheminformatics for
diversity analysis, hit triaging, and compound prioritization.

This project serves as a foundation for downstream ML and QSAR modeling.
